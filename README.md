# Auto Migration Data Bot
The bot uses a non-visual data migration from the first ekap.kazatomprom.kz to ekap-v2.kazatomprom.kz, where transferring MySQL data to PostgreSQL would take a lot of time due to the database table relationships, etc. Therefore, this bot simulates migration in offline mode according to a scenario. It is also worth noting that the bot uses WebSocket, which tells us that we can start the migration in multiple threads, increase the load, and perform data migration faster.
